WIP - Still being built.

Sidenote:

Any methodology's routines to consolidate pieces of information over multiple contexts described in text, can also be described as a series of single or multi-bit encoding and arguments.
0001 - write a paragraph about a tree
0100 - describe the tree

But in terms of consolidating information, you can ex.store/get/read values etc...
You can bake it in. Or fine-tune with custom tokens inside training set, in a smaller LLM model of a complete system.
